# Portfolio_v2

### Overview

Portfolio_v2 is my personal portfolio built with Vite for faster development and built with components from Material UI. The portfolio is divided into four different sections that can be easily reached via the navbar. Also featured in the navbar is the translations icon where you can pick out a language to use that uses React-INTL under the hood.
