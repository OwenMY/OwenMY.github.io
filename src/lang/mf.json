  "about.work.description": "Look, I’m a front-end engineer with two damn years of hands-on experience, alright? I’ve been in the trenches, building scalable apps, wrangling full-stack madness with React, TypeScript, and AWS—yeah, I’m talkin’ Lambda and CloudFormation. I love tearing into tough-ass tech problems, especially when it's about automating stuff and making workflows smooth as hell. Now I’m lookin’ for a role where I can bring the heat, flex these skills, and level up like a badass. You feel me?",

I was part of a badass, world-class squadron—yeah, the best in the Corps—that set a world freakin’ record for the furthest a Huey had ever flown. That’s history, baby. The grit and skills I earned in that uniform? They made me tough as nails and sharp as hell in any environment. And get this—I was signing off on aircraft when I was just 19. Let that sink in.",
  "about.machinist.description": "Before I got into this software engineering game, I was an EDM specialist. And no, motherf**er, not the damn music — I’m talkin’ Electrical Discharge Machining. I was out here programming machines with G and M code, crafting parts so precise they could split a damn hair into three! That’s right — THREE. During the pandemic, I had the once-in-a-lifetime chance to make the molds for the Covid test kits that helped the whole damn country. That’s impact, baby!",
