  "about.work.description": "Look, I’m a front-end engineer with two damn years of hands-on experience, alright? I’ve been in the trenches, building scalable apps, wrangling full-stack madness with React, TypeScript, and AWS—yeah, I’m talkin’ Lambda and CloudFormation. I love tearing into tough-ass tech problems, especially when it's about automating stuff and making workflows smooth as hell. Now I’m lookin’ for a role where I can bring the heat, flex these skills, and level up like a badass. You feel me?"
