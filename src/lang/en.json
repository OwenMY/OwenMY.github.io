  "about.military.description": "I am also a Marine Corps veteran who served five years as cobra and huey mechanic. I had the luxury to be apart of a world class squadron who was named Best Squadron of the Marine Corps and whom has also broke the world record for the furthest a huey has every flown at the time. The skills and experiences I have gained through my service have given me the resilience and aptitude needed to succeeded in harsh environments. Fun fact, I was signing off aircraft at 19 years old."
